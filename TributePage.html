            "There is a word that I love called Querétaro, which is a city in Mexico. I feel that there is no more beautiful word in Spanish than Querétaro, Written beautifully well structured, it is long and has this mixture of q, u, e. The u that is silent, but that space is necessary, otherwise querer (to love) would not be querer (to love)."
